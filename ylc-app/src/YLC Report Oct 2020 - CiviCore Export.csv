Hope for Justice's global work, across three continents, is categorized as follows:  Rescue: Our specialist teams work closely with law enforcement to identify victims of trafficking and modern slavery, build bridges of trust with them and remove them from exploitation.  Restore: We work with victims to overcome trauma and rebuild their lives. We offer tailored restorative care initiatives and offer support to meet vital needs.  Reform: We train people to spot the signs of trafficking and act on it, and seek policy change by influencing governments and support agencies. We work with businesses to eliminate modern slavery from their operations and supply chains.  Following a recent visit to the White House to brief the President and his staff in person about the issue of human trafficking and the need for more resources to be devoted to this crime, we are working closely with federal and state legislators to improve the response to trafficking.   Hope for Justice's US headquarters is in Nashville, TN. The Tennessee Investigative Center is run by licensed investigators who co-ordinate closely with local law enforcement to assist directly in the rescue of all types of trafficking victims. They also act as specialist consultants to law enforcement teams handling trafficking cases. Our referrals come both from the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline - for which we are an official referral agency - and from law enforcement.

Nashville Opportunities Industrialization Center / Nashville OIC,,"THE OIC MISSION:  OIC will enable unemployed and underemployed persons who are ready and willing achieve a better quality of life through education, job training and job placement services.     THE OIC MOTTO:  We help others help themselves.     THE OIC VISION:  OIC will be the premier provider of adult education preparation, job training and job placement services in Middle Tennessee.     After 50 years, Nashville OIC's mission still resonates. What could be more relevant in today's tough economic times than helping people build their qualifications and get jobs? Having a job has a favorable impact not just on the employed individual but also on family and friends, and even on the community. When a person has a job, that person is contributing, paying taxes rather than being a drain on society.     Today there is much concern about poverty and homelessness. Extensive community effort is devoted to alleviating hardship. Yet society is largely treating the symptoms.OIC attacks a root cause of these ills by helping people gain employment.     Reverend Leon H. Sullivan, who founded OIC, brought a revolutionary concept to workforce development. Before, training provided had often turned out to be irrelevant to the needs of employers. Reverend Sullivan started by understanding what employers required. He never asked an employer to compromise job qualifications. On the other end of the process, he accepted people into the program where they were. He recognized that the job at the end of training provided the primary motivation for participants to make the sacrifices necessary for success. OIC provides no stipends. People are there because they are committed to changing their lives. These changes are measurable:  *        Monthly tests show gains in grade level.  *        A person demonstrates mastery of a Microsoft module, such as Word, by passing a test.  *        A person gets a job.",,www.oicnashville.org,06/30/2018,Helena,Farrow,hfarrow@oicnashville.org,Ralph,Mullenax,ralphmullenax@capstarbank.com,2.00,2,,,,No,Yes,4,0,5,0,,0,,0,1,4,5,0,,,Declined to Update
