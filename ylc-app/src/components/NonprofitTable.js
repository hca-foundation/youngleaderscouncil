There is a community and economic impact by families moving from government dependency to self-sufficiency. The economic impact of CCSI has achieved an estimated savings of $3.2 million to taxpayers in government subsidies by families moving off of government assistance into their own homes or private rentals.  Additionally, over 131 families have become homeowners and contributed to the local economy over $15 million in housing sales and estimated property taxes of over $1,194,524 in 22 years. The community benefits from increased numbers of stable families getting involved in their communities and contributing to the local economy.

The training tool that we have been using to achieve this goal has been refurbishing bikes. In addition to learning the different skills associated with maintaining a bike the participants also receive a bike after completion of the program. Among the many life principles that are taught in this process it also creates a sense of ownership and pride for bicycles. Nashville has many other programs that help get kids off the street and learn skills that can improve their life. In receiving a bike they can take advantage of these opportunities and in doing so brighten the future of the next generation.",

It has an effective and proven aftercare model that is replicable and scalable. Hope for Justice's global work, across three continents, is categorized as follows:  Rescue: Our specialist teams work closely with law enforcement to identify victims of trafficking and modern slavery, build bridges of trust with them and remove them from exploitation.  Restore: We work with victims to overcome trauma and rebuild their lives. We offer tailored restorative care initiatives and offer support to meet vital needs.  Reform: We train people to spot the signs of trafficking and act on it, and seek policy change by influencing governments and support agencies. We work with businesses to eliminate modern slavery from their operations and supply chains.  Following a recent visit to the White House to brief the President and his staff in person about the issue of human trafficking and the need for more resources to be devoted to this crime, we are working closely with federal and state legislators to improve the response to trafficking.   Hope for Justice's US headquarters is in Nashville, TN. The Tennessee Investigative Center is run by licensed investigators who co-ordinate closely with local law enforcement to assist directly in the rescue of all types of trafficking victims. They also act as specialist consultants to law enforcement teams handling trafficking cases. Our referrals come both from the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline - for which we are an official referral agency - and from law enforcement. As well as conducting investigations in co-ordination with law enforcement agencies, the Hub also acts as an alternative pathway for victims too scared to speak directly to the authorities to safely report their situation.",

Year-over-year NHA is voted \"Best Shelter\" and \"Favorite Not-For-Profit\", and is proud to have a save rate of 99%.\n\nNashville Humane by the numbers in 2019: \n3,524 homes for homeless and adoptable pets\nFor the second year in a row, and the second year ever, NHA celebrated a save-rate of 99 percent\nNHA assisted 47 unique urban and rural shelter partners\n1,310 total animals benefited from NHA's transport program.\n10,631 volunteer hours were logged at NHA\nNearly one-third of all the animals that we serviced participated in our foster program for a total of 1351\n\n\nIn 2020, Nashville Humane faces a new challenge... On the heels of the devastating tornadoes that struck middle Tennessee, the COVID19 crisis has forced NHA to close its public operations. WIth that closure comes the cancelling of major fundraising events, and the loss of a considerable amount of operational income. This year we're raising funds during the Big Payback to simply keep the shelter \"doggie\" doors open and everything up and running.",

THE OIC MOTTO:  We help others help themselves.     THE OIC VISION:  OIC will be the premier provider of adult education preparation, job training and job placement services in Middle Tennessee.     After 50 years, Nashville OIC's mission still resonates. What could be more relevant in today's tough economic times than helping people build their qualifications and get jobs? Having a job has a favorable impact not just on the employed individual but also on family and friends, and even on the community. When a person has a job, that person is contributing, paying taxes rather than being a drain on society.     Today there is much concern about poverty and homelessness. Extensive community effort is devoted to alleviating hardship. Yet society is largely treating the symptoms.OIC attacks a root cause of these ills by helping people gain employment.     Reverend Leon H. Sullivan, who founded OIC, brought a revolutionary concept to workforce development. Before, training provided had often turned out to be irrelevant to the needs of employers. Reverend Sullivan started by understanding what employers required. He never asked an employer to compromise job qualifications. On the other end of the process, he accepted people into the program where they were. He recognized that the job at the end of training provided the primary motivation for participants to make the sacrifices necessary for success. OIC provides no stipends. People are there because they are committed to changing their lives. These changes are measurable:  *        Monthly tests show gains in grade level.  *        A person demonstrates mastery of a Microsoft module, such as Word, by passing a test.  *        A person gets a job.",

Contemporary Christian Music artist Michael W. Smith founded Rocketown in 1994 with a vision of serving youth that are disconnected from mainstream society. The approach was and still is holistic at it's core, combining ministerial outreach services with academic and social enrichment programs so that we may nurture the physical, emotional/intellectual, and spiritual health of every young person who comes through our doors. Rocketown as a community of faith is committed to reflecting God's unconditional love and prevenient grace in relationships of truth, commitment, and authenticity that embrace all people. As a community, we eat, play, pray, and worship together. An understanding of our inter-relatedness as children of God drives the philosophy of ministry at Rocketown.      Rocketown has served more than 1,000,000 under-resourced and at-risk youth since its inception through youth development programs, youth arts initiatives, intramural sports and sporting events, youth ministry and outreach programs, and attraction based activities and services like the basketball courts, recording studio, skatepark, gaming center, and live concert venues.   Rocketown embraces the concept of being open and available to students during the out-of-school hours to keep youth engaged in activities that keep them out of trouble and safe, engaged and off the streets.  These extended hours make Rocketown unique from other youth centers as we are open until 8PM during the week and 11PM on the weekends.  We are proud to serve the Nashville Community and consider our location in downtown to be accessible to all MNPS students but also many youth from around the middle Tennessee area.  Our doors are open to all who want to attend and most services are FREE.",

We bring that mission to life on our 34-acre farm in Franklin, Tennessee by providing six affordable and accessible year-round outcome based equine assisted  programs. We serve participants from 11 counties who are diagnosed with over 50 different disabilities. Our trained, licensed and certified staff and volunteers understand that each child at Saddle Up! is an able individual within their diagnosis. Children may ride from age 2 through age 24- 22 years of progress!Our certified instructors and licensed therapists customize lessons and appointments to each child's needs. Our services are medically necessary to many families that have limited financial means to access physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Adaptive therapeutic riding instruction incorporates social, emotional, cognitive, mental, and physical goals.Saddle Up! therapists often state that their clients reach their goals faster using the power of the horse. Our agency provides a safe space to for families and their children to make friends, share resources, and build core emotional, cognitive, and physical strength. Riders take pride in the fact that they 'have a sport' just like their typically developing peers.Saddle Up!'s adaptive services are a necessary part of the healthy development of atypical children and youth. At Saddle Up! the non-judgmental bond of the horse and child brings progress often unseen in a clinical or academic setting: First words- a horse's name, the word whoa; walking unassisted after building core strength; no longer needing hip surgery because of the stretch, balance and core strength gained by riding are just a few of the milestones achieved!Saddle Up! is a premier PATH Intl. facility, and serves as a resource to other centers and the community at large for continuing education, mentorship, and collaboration.",
